# pqt [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/piotrkowalczuk/pqt?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/piotrkowalczuk/pqt)&nbsp;![go workflow](https://github.com/piotrkowalczuk/pqt/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg?branch=piotrkowalczuk/gh-action)

This package is a toolbox for Postgres driven applications.
It provides multiple tools to help to work with Postgres efficiently.
In comparison to other currently available libraries instead of pushing struct tags into anti-pattern or parsing SQL, it allows defining schema programmatically.

From a developer perspective, pqt is primarily a toolkit generator, not an ORM. 
It means it is focusing on bringing low-level building blocks. 
[Generated DAL](https://github.com/piotrkowalczuk/pqt/wiki/Features#data-access-layer) (Data Access Layer) is only a (desired) side effect, a proof that those components fit together well.

A developer gets full access to the internals. 
Building your own, type-safe logic takes minutes. 
As a result, transition in and out is easy. 
No fear that you will be stuck with an ORM that doesn't meet your requirements anymore.

## Example

The package itself does not provide any command line application that would generate output out of given input. 
Instead, it encourages to write local generation application next to the proper package. 
A good example of how such an application could be structured can be found in [examples](https://github.com/piotrkowalczuk/pqt/tree/master/example).

By default, the example is trying to connect to local `test` database on the default port.
To run it simply call:

```bash
$ make gen // not necessary, since generated code is already part of the repo
$ make run
```

## Plugins
